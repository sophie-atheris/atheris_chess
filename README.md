My attempt at coding a chess engine from scratch in python
My goal is to use only stdlib modules, while still being at least somewhat performant for a chess engine
As I'm coding all the chess logic from scratch in python, and trying to avoid looking up the solutions, it's not very fast
The current version doesn't have an engine yet as that's going to be majorly rewritten
